# Game-Pack

“GameGrabber” game-pack. This is a collection
of four simple games, most/all of which feature a simple “game loop” in which the user repeatedly guesses at a correct answer:

• Hangman (guess a word letter-at-a-time)

• NumberGuesser (guess a secret number getting “higher” and “lower” clues as you go)

• RockPaperScissors (play rock paper scissors against a random-AI)

• WordJumble (guess a word based on the jumbled up letters of the word.)
